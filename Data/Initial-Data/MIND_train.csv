James Holzhauer and Emma Boettcher finally reunited in the Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions 2-night final. Boettcher knocked Holzhauer out of regular Jeopardy! play back in June, when he was only $58,484 short of Ken Jennings massive $2.62 million in winnings. Ever since that day fans have been hoping for a rematch. Leading up to the rematch, Holzhauer had playfully tweeted about getting his revenge. He got off to a hot start, answering 23 clues correctly. Boettcher was only able to get 13 correct answers, so going into ""Final Jeopardy!"" Holzhauer ($37,412) had nearly three times as much money as Boettcher ($13,200). Boettcher went all in with her wager for the category ""Old Testament Book."" The clue was, ""By Hebrew word count, the longest book bears this name that led to a word for a long complaint or rant."" Emma correctly answered, ""What is Jeremiah?"" Holzhauer also got the correct answer and bid $11,914, bringing his grand total for the first night to $49,326. Fans took to Twitter to discuss his dominant performance. It should be noted that there is a third contestant in the finals, Francois Barcomb. Unfortunately he ended the night with only $1,800 and it is highly unlikely he will pose much of a threat to the other juggernauts.

A group traveling along a remote road in Gjirokast r, Albania, on November 11 had to do a double-take as they passed a flock of sheep blocking traffic. There, among the sheep, was an equally white and fluffy dog who looked more than happy to join the crowd. A German visitor to the region, Matthias Goedeking, took the video and told Storyful that he and his traveling companions originally came across ""a herd of sheep on the road and a shepherd who was visibly unhappy about that fact."" When they spotted the dog in the crowd, they followed alongside the pooch for a while, before it disappeared   Where's Waldo? style   into the white mass of sheep surrounding it. Goedeking said a combination of very careful driving, the ""shepherd banging his crook"" on a railing, as well as ""lots of honking the car"" got him and his companions past the horde of furry creatures in the end.

There aren't many things that are scarier than a lion. But a lion ""packed full of bees"" would definitely be on the list. Rihan Hoglin, of Hoglin Honey Bees, posted this video to Instagram after he and his team collected the statue from a property in Manning, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, on October 21. The caption said, ""You don't come across this every day   a lion statue packed full of bees. Wouldn't this be an awesome antitheft deterrent sitting in front of your house?"" Hoglin told Storyful that he and his team had been called to remove the bees from the garden decoration by its 75-year-old owner, who happened to be ""highly allergic to bee stings."" The statue meant a great deal to its owner because it was a gift from her late grandson, Hoglin said. Hoglin Honey Bees removed the bees from the statue free of charge as a gesture of kindness.

As bushfires hit New South Wales throughout October and into November, the team at Bio Logic Tree Services in Corndale has been kept busy, with forests heavily hit by the flames. While working on ""hazardous trees"" damaged during the Busbys Flat Fire on October 12, one of the company's arborists, Benjamin Garland, captured footage showing how the bushfire left one tree a hollowed-out, smoldering shell of its former self. Calling it a ""chimney tree"", the company posted footage of Garland's find to Instagram on November 12. ""At the end of the day on the way home, I spotted the tree burning on the inside and stopped to investigate,"" Garland told Storyful. ""I estimate the tree had been burning for a few days and after returning at later date the fire had gone out and only a thin outer shell of the tree was left,"" he said. On November 15, firefighters in New South Wales were still dealing with widespread fires in the state. A statement from the News South Wales Rural Fire Service said that on November 16, ""more than 130 brigades"" would open their doors ""to chat with residents about their local risk, property preparation and making a plan,"" for the rest of the fire season.

Ladies and gentlemen, it pains us to bring you this most tragic of slideshows. Actually, it really doesn't. In fact, we're rather excited to showcase what the future might hold for BMW should this current fascination with fantastically large grilles be allowed to continue unchecked. Perhaps this in-your-face display of kidneys gone wild will at least encourage designers in Munich to think twice before traveling further down this road. Us Motor1.com scribes work very hard to keep a neutral tone, but frankly, we're a bit worried about BMW. This big-grille fad is as ridiculous as the pet rock only without the cool hipster factor. It's as off-putting as listening to glam rock on a scratched-up record. We blame Lexus for this, and while some brands have pulled off the gaping grille with admirable results   we're looking at you, Audi RS6 Avant   oversized kidneys basically turn every BMW into a beaver joke waiting to happen. That's not a good thing. Bigger Isn't Better: BMW Concept 4 Debuts With Massive Double Kidney Grille Reviled BMW Concept 4 Grille Redesigned By Another Fan We aren't alone on this. Peruse the comments of any Motor1.com articles referencing this bonkers nose and you'll find plenty of criticism. Rendering artists the world over have attempted to make the big grille look better, while others   including the anonymous designer who graciously sent us the designs featured above   are ready to show us a world where every BMW is, in a word, ugly. And yes, with BMW's deep involvement in the Toyota Supra, we couldn't resist leading with a makeover that could well come to the Supra's convertible twin, the Z4. Sure, the facelift could've been on an actual Z4, but seeing the double kidney on a Supra has a bit more shock factor. Jump into the slideshow at the top of this article to see just how deep   and how big   this kidney-shaped rabbit hole can grow.

I'm a queer woman partnered with a transgender man, but everyone assumes we're a heterosexual couple. On the surface, we're the quintessential Brooklyn duo: We have tasteful tattoos and piercings, we shop at food co-ops, we attend spin class together, and we're creative yet gainfully employed.
